# Step-by-Step Guide to GPU Benchmark Optimization

This guide provides clear instructions on how to set up and run the optimized GPU benchmarks for the hackathon challenge.

## 1. Environment Setup

First, set up your environment with the necessary dependencies:

```bash
# Create a Python virtual environment
python -m venv --system-site-packages venv

# Activate the virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/Mac
# or
venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows

# Install required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt

# For vLLM benchmark, install vLLM
pip install vllm
```

## 2. Running the Standard Optimized Benchmark

The `optimized_benchmark.py` script uses standard Hugging Face Transformers with several optimizations:

- Increased batch size
- Multi-threading for input preparation
- Comprehensive GPU monitoring
- Detailed performance metrics

To run this benchmark:

```bash
python optimized_benchmark.py
```

## 3. Running the vLLM Benchmark

The `vllm_benchmark.py` script uses the vLLM library for maximum GPU utilization:

- Optimized memory management
- Continuous batching
- PagedAttention for efficient KV cache handling
- High GPU core utilization

To run this benchmark:

```bash
python vllm_benchmark.py
```

## 4. Comparing Results

Run both benchmarks on the RTX 5090 and H200 GPUs to compare performance:

1. Record the throughput (tokens/sec) for each benchmark on each GPU
2. Compare GPU utilization percentages
3. Check if the H200 outperforms the 5090 when properly optimized

## 5. Applying to dwani.ai

These optimization techniques can be applied to your dwani.ai voice AI platform:

1. **For ASR models**: Use batching and vLLM-style optimizations to process multiple audio inputs simultaneously
2. **For Translation models**: Implement multi-threading and efficient memory management
3. **For TTS models**: Apply GPU monitoring to identify and resolve bottlenecks

## 6. Troubleshooting

- **Out of Memory errors**: Reduce batch size or try quantization
- **Low GPU utilization**: Increase batch size or switch to vLLM
- **High latency**: Check for CPU bottlenecks in data preparation

## 7. Next Steps

After successful benchmarking:

1. Apply the best-performing techniques to your production models
2. Implement monitoring to track performance over time
3. Consider quantization for deployment on edge devices

By following these steps, you'll maximize GPU utilization and improve the performance of both your benchmark and your dwani.ai platform.
