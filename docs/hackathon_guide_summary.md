# GPU Benchmark Optimization Guide for Hackathon and dwani.ai

## Summary of Findings

After analyzing the hackathon files and your dwani.ai project context, here's a comprehensive guide to help you optimize GPU performance for both the benchmark challenge and your voice AI platform.

## Key Insights

1. **Current Benchmark Limitations**: The existing benchmark code doesn't fully utilize GPU cores, which is why the RTX 5090 outperforms the H200 (when it shouldn't).

2. **Optimization Priorities**: Focus on maximizing parallelism through batching, using specialized inference libraries, and implementing proper monitoring.

3. **dwani.ai Connection**: The same optimization techniques that will help win the hackathon can directly improve your Time to First Token Generation (TTFTG) for ASR, Translation, and TTS models.

## Step-by-Step Implementation Plan

### 1. Environment Setup

```bash
# Clone repository and set up environment
git clone https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp.git
cd llama.cpp
cmake -B build -DGGML_CUDA=ON
cmake --build build --config Release -j2

# Create Python environment
python -m venv --system-site-packages venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Benchmark Optimization Steps

#### Step 1: Optimize Batch Size
Start with the current batch size (32) and gradually increase it until you hit memory limits. This is the simplest yet most effective optimization.

```python
# Modify BATCH_SIZE in benchmark_win.py
BATCH_SIZE = 64  # Try increasing from 32 to 64, 96, 128, etc.
```

#### Step 2: Implement vLLM for Higher Throughput
vLLM is specifically designed for high-throughput LLM inference and will better utilize GPU cores.

```python
# Install vLLM
pip install vllm

# Create a new benchmark script using vLLM
from vllm import LLM, SamplingParams
import time
import pynvml

MODEL_NAME = "Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B"
BATCH_SIZE = 32  # Adjust based on testing
BENCHMARK_DURATION = 300  # 5 minutes
PROMPT = "Write a technical explanation of how GPUs process neural networks, in exactly 100 words."

# Initialize vLLM with high GPU utilization
llm = LLM(model=MODEL_NAME, dtype="float16", gpu_memory_utilization=0.9)
sampling_params = SamplingParams(temperature=0.0, max_tokens=256)

# Run benchmark
prompts = [PROMPT] * BATCH_SIZE
total_tokens = 0
total_generations = 0
start_time = time.time()
end_time = start_time + BENCHMARK_DURATION

while time.time() < end_time:
    outputs = llm.generate(prompts, sampling_params)
    # Count tokens and update metrics
    batch_tokens = sum(len(output.outputs[0].token_ids) for output in outputs)
    total_tokens += batch_tokens
    total_generations += BATCH_SIZE

# Calculate and print results
elapsed = time.time() - start_time
throughput = total_tokens / elapsed
print(f"Throughput: {throughput:.2f} tokens/sec")
```

#### Step 3: Add Multi-Threading for Preparation Tasks
Use threads to prepare inputs and process outputs while the GPU is working.

```python
import concurrent.futures

# Create a thread pool for input preparation and output processing
with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=4) as executor:
    # Submit batch preparation tasks to threads
    futures = []
    for _ in range(num_batches):
        futures.append(executor.submit(prepare_batch, prompts))
    
    # Process results as they complete
    for future in concurrent.futures.as_completed(futures):
        prepared_batch = future.result()
        # Send to GPU for processing
        outputs = llm.generate(prepared_batch, sampling_params)
        # Process outputs (can also be done in threads)
```

#### Step 4: Implement Detailed GPU Monitoring
Add comprehensive monitoring to identify bottlenecks and ensure full utilization.

```python
# Initialize NVML
pynvml.nvmlInit()
handle = pynvml.nvmlDeviceGetHandleByIndex(0)

# Inside benchmark loop
utilization = pynvml.nvmlDeviceGetUtilizationRates(handle)
gpu_util = utilization.gpu  # GPU core utilization percentage
mem_util = utilization.memory  # Memory utilization percentage
temp = pynvml.nvmlDeviceGetTemperature(handle, pynvml.NVML_TEMPERATURE_GPU)
power = pynvml.nvmlDeviceGetPowerUsage(handle) / 1000.0

print(f"GPU Utilization: {gpu_util}%, Memory: {mem_util}%, Temp: {temp}Â°C, Power: {power}W")

# Check for thermal throttling
throttle_reasons = pynvml.nvmlDeviceGetCurrentClocksThrottleReasons(handle)
if throttle_reasons > 0:
    print("Warning: GPU is throttling!")
```

#### Step 5: Try Quantization for Even Larger Batches
If memory is still a constraint, implement quantization to fit larger batches.

```python
# Install bitsandbytes
pip install bitsandbytes

# Load model with 8-bit quantization
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, BitsAndBytesConfig

quantization_config = BitsAndBytesConfig(
    load_in_8bit=True,
    llm_int8_threshold=6.0
)

model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
    MODEL_NAME,
    quantization_config=quantization_config,
    device_map="auto"
)
```

### 3. Application to dwani.ai Voice AI Platform

#### For ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition):
- Implement batching to process multiple audio inputs simultaneously
- Use quantization to run models efficiently on edge devices
- Monitor GPU utilization to ensure optimal performance

#### For Translation:
- Use vLLM or similar libraries to maximize throughput
- Implement multi-threading to manage the pipeline between ASR and TTS
- Track tokens/sec to measure and improve performance

#### For TTS (Text-to-Speech):
- Optimize batch size for audio generation
- Use GPU monitoring to identify and resolve bottlenecks
- Implement real-time throughput measurement

## Expected Outcomes

1. **For Hackathon**: With proper optimization, the H200 should outperform the RTX 5090, demonstrating that your benchmark effectively utilizes GPU cores.

2. **For dwani.ai**: These optimizations should significantly reduce Time to First Token Generation (TTFTG), improving the responsiveness of your voice AI services for Kannada and other Indian languages.

## Next Steps

1. Implement the optimizations in stages, measuring performance after each change
2. Run the optimized benchmark on both the RTX 5090 and H200
3. Apply the same optimization principles to your dwani.ai ASR, Translation, and TTS pipeline
4. Continue monitoring and fine-tuning based on real-world usage patterns

By following this guide, you'll not only have a strong entry for the hackathon but also valuable insights and techniques to improve your voice AI platform's performance and user experience.
